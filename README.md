# Simulation of Plane Wave Interaction with Dielectric Slab

## Overview

In this exercise, we investigate the interaction of a plane wave with a dielectric slab and analyze the reflection coefficient under different conditions. The simulation is carried out using COMSOL Multiphysics. The tasks are as follows:

1. **Reflection Coefficient Calculation for a Dielectric Slab**: Analyze the reflection coefficient of a dielectric slab enclosed on both sides by air.
2. **Matching Conditions**: Determine if the reflection coefficient can be zero when the right side of the slab is replaced with a dielectric material and the slab is a quarter wavelength long.
3. **Multi-layer Dielectric Slab**: Use a multi-layer dielectric slab to correct the impedance matching issue identified in Task 2.

## Software and Files
